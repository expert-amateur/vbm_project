  By not providing "FindOPEN_CV.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "OPEN_CV", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OPEN_CV" with any
  of the following names:

    OPEN_CVConfig.cmake
    open_cv-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OPEN_CV" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OPEN_CV_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OPEN_CV" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
